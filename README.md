# Duncan Ritchie’s first JavaScript challenges
This is a series of challenges I completed at the beginning of my first course at the Code Nation bootcamp, way back when I was starting to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript. (I have improved the CSS a little bit since.)

Most interesting of these is [my chess game](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/jsChallenges/chess/chess.html) — I was the only student in my class of seventeen to even attempt to code up the logic of chess. I admit I never implemented *en passant*, and if a pawn reaches the opposite edge it will be promoted to queen only, and the code is not particularly Solid or easy to read, and the user interface is a bit awkward in that you have to type your moves into an `<input input="text">` element; but it’s still pretty impressive given that four weeks earlier I didn’t know what the “document object model” was.

For more context and more projects, including in React.js and Windows Forms, see [my website](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/code.html).
